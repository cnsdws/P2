Project 2 - xkcd Password Generator

Description
This website will generate a unique password for use in various contexts.
It does so by randomly generating and connecting words that will be easy for you to remember but 
hard for computers to crack or people to guess. The inspiration for this approach came from a comic
strip that discussed the approach at xkcd.com.

At 3 or more words, it will give you a very secure password.

Since some sites have criteria that require numbers or special characters, those can be added as options. 
You can also add camelcase words or hyphens in between words to help memorization.
